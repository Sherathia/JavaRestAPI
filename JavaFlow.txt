1. Once request comes to Dispatcher servlet  
- Creates httpserveletrequest and resposne objects 
- delegated request to handler mapping(Get mapping etc multiple mapping)
- controller method is invoked

HandlerMapping is a Spring MVC component that helps the DispatcherServlet decide which controller method should 
handle an incoming request.

Client sends: /products
DispatcherServlet receives the request
It asks HandlerMapping:
“Which controller method should handle /products?”
HandlerMapping checks your controllers, @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc.
It returns the correct handler method to DispatcherServlet.

A controller in Spring MVC (or any MVC framework) is responsible for handling incoming requests, 
executing business logic (often through services), and returning the appropriate response or view.
